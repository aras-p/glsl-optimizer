<H1>Mesa 6.5.2 Release Notes / (in progress)</H1>

<p>
Mesa 6.5.2 is a 6.5 follow-on development release mostly consisting of
<a href="versions.html#6.5.1">bug fixes</a>.
</p>


<h2>MD5 checksums</h2>
<pre>
TBD
</pre>


<h2>New features</h2>
<ul>
<li>New DRI memory manager system.  Currently used by the i915tex driver.
Other DRI drivers will be updated to use the new memory manager in coming
months.
<br>
To use the new driver you'll need the most recent DRM library and drivers
(version 2.2 or later) and a recent xf86-video-intel driver module from X.org.
<br>
New features resulting from this work include:
<ul>
<li>EXT_framebuffer_objects, render to texture
<li>ARB_pixel_buffer_objects
<li>Accelerated CopyTexSubimage, DrawPixels, ReadPixels, CopyPixels
<li>Accelerated texture uploads from pixel buffer objects
<li>Potentially texturing directly from the pixel buffer object (zero 
copy texturing).
</ul>
<li>New Intel i965 DRI driver
<li>New <code>minstall</code> script to replace normal install program
<li>Faster fragment program execution in software
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>fixed invalid memory read while rendering textured points (bug 8320)
<li>fixed problems with freebsd-dri configuration (bug 8344)
<li>Mesa's fake glxGetCurrentContext() wasn't thread-aware
<li>OPTION NV_position_invariant didn't work in NV vertex programs
<li>glDrawPixels into a user-created framebuffer object could crash Xlib driver
<li>Line clipping was broken in some circumstances
<li>fragment.fogcoord register didn't always contain the correct value
<li>RGBA logicops didn't work reliably in some DRI drivers
<li>Fixed broken RGBA LogicOps in Intel DRI drivers
<li>Fixed some fragment program bugs in Intel i915 DRI driver
</ul>


<h2>Internal code changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The device driver functions ResizeBuffers and GetBufferSize have been
decprecated.
<li>OpenGL 2.0 and 2.1 support is nearly done.
</ul>


<h2>To Do (someday) items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Switch to freeglut
<li>Increase MAX_DRAWBUFFERS
<li>Fix linux-glide target/driver.
<li>Improved lambda and derivative calculation for frag progs.
</ul>
