<h2>June 2003</h2>

<p>
Mesa's directory tree has been overhauled.
Things are better organized now with some thought toward future needs.
</p>
<p>
In CVS, the latest Mesa 5.1 development code is now rooted under the
<b>Mesa-newtree/</b> directory.  The old top-level <b>Mesa/</b> directory
holds the Mesa 5.0.x code which will be abandoned at some point.
</p>



<h2>March 30, 2003</h2>

<p>Please report any problems with this release ASAP. Bugs should be filed on the
Mesa3D website at sourceforge.<br>
After 3.2 is wrapped up I hope to release 3.3 beta 1 soon afterward.</p>

</p><h2>December 14, 1999</h2>
<p>Mesa 3.1 is released!</p>
<p>
</p><h2>September 21, 1999</h2>
<p>There appear to be two new files on the ftp site, <a href="ftp://ftp.mesa3d.org/mesa/beta/MesaLib-3.1beta3.tar.gz">MesaLib-3.1beta3.tar.gz</a>
and <a href="ftp://ftp.mesa3d.org/mesa/beta/MesaDemos-3.1beta3.tar.gz">MesaDemos-3.1beta3.tar.gz</a>,
that seem to be... yes, I've just received confirmation from the beta center, they
are indeed the <b>THIRD</b> beta release of Mesa 3.1! Happy Days. Happy Days. Thanks
Keith Whitwell for preparing these for us during Brian's absence.</p>

</p><h2>August 30, 1999</h2>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that I've accepted a position with Precision Insight,
Inc. effective October, 1999. I'll be leaving Avid Technology in September.</p>
<p>I've been working on Mesa in my spare time for over five years. With Precision
Insight I now have the opportunity to devote my full attention to advancing Mesa
and OpenGL on Linux.</p>
<p>While I'll be focused on Linux, the X Window System, and hardware acceleration,
my work will continue to be open sourced and available to any other programmers who
may want to contribute to it, or use it for other projects or platforms</p>
<p>PS: I'm going to be traveling until Sep 6 and won't be reading email until then.</p>
<p>
</p><h2>August 23, 1999</h2>
<p>Anonymous CVS access is back online so suck up all the bandwidth you can afford.
Note that this is a new archive, so you will need to re-checkout the archive. That
means don't <i>cvs update</i> from a previous download.</p>
<p>
</p><h2>August 17, 1999</h2>
<p>A report from the SIGGRAPH '99 Linux/OpenGL
BOF meeting is now available.</p>

<p>
</p><h2>August 14, 1999</h2>
<p>www.mesa3d.org is having technical problems due to hardware failures at VA Linux
systems. The Mac pages, ftp, and CVS services aren't fully restored yet. Please be
patient.</p>

</p><h2>June 2, 1999</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/">nVidia</a> has released some Linux binaries for
xfree86 3.3.3.1, along with the <b>full source</b>, which includes GLX acceleration
based on Mesa 3.0. They can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Products.nsf/htmlmedia/software_drivers.html">http://www.nvidia.com/Products.nsf/htmlmedia/software_drivers.html</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><h2>May 24, 1999</h2>
<p>Beta 2 of Mesa 3.1 has been make available at <a href="ftp://ftp.mesa3d.org/mesa/beta/">ftp://ftp.mesa3d.org/mesa/beta/</a>.
If you are into the quake scene, you may want to try this out, as it contains some
optimizations specifically in the Q3A rendering path.
<p>
</p><h2>May 13, 1999</h2>
<p>For those interested in the integration of Mesa into XFree86 4.0, Precision Insight
has posted their lowlevel design documents at http://www.precisioninsight.com.</p>

</p><h2>May 13, 1999</h2>
<pre>May 1999 - John Carmack of id Software, Inc. has made a donation of
US$10,000 to the Mesa project to support its continuing development.
Mesa is a free implementation of the OpenGL 3D graphics library and id's
newest game, Quake 3 Arena, will use Mesa as the 3D renderer on Linux.

The donation will go to Keith Whitwell, who has been optimizing Mesa to
improve performance on 3d hardware.  Thanks to Keith's work, many
applications using Mesa 3.1 will see a dramatic performance increase
over Mesa 3.0.  The donation will allow Keith to continue working on
Mesa full time for some time to come.

For more information about Mesa see www.mesa3d.org.  For more
information about id Software, Inc. see www.idsoftware.com.

--------------------------------

This donation from John/id is very generous.  Keith and I are very
grateful.

</p><h2>May 1, 1999</h2>
<p>John Carmack made an interesting .plan update yesterday:

</p><ul>
	<i>"I put together a document on optimizing OpenGL drivers for Q3 that
	should be helpful to the various Linux 3D teams. <br>
	</i>http://www.quake3arena.com/news/glopt.html</i>"
</ul>

<p>
</p><h2>April 7, 1999</h2>
<p>Updated the Mesa contributors section and added links to RPM Mesa packages.</p>
<p>
</p><h2>March 18, 1999</h2>
<p>The new webpages are now online. Enjoy, and let me know if you find any errors.

</p><h2>February 16, 1999</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.sgi.com/">SGI</a> releases its <a href="http://www.sgi.com/software/opensource/glx/">GLX
source code</a>.</p>
