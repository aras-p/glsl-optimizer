<h1>Help Wanted / To-Do List</h1>

<p>
We can always use more help with the Mesa project.
Here are some specific ideas and areas where help would be appreciated:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Driver patching and testing.</b>
Patches are often posted to the <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/mesa-dev" target="_parent">mesa-dev mailing list</a>, but aren't
immediately checked into git because not enough people are testing them.
Just applying patches, testing and reporting back is helpful.
<li>
<b>Driver debugging.</b>
There are plenty of open bugs in the <a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Mesa" target="_parent">bug database</a>.
<li>
<b>Remove aliasing warnings.</b>
Enable gcc -Wstrict-aliasing=2 -fstrict-aliasing and track down aliasing
issues in the code.
<li>
<b>Windows driver building, testing and maintenance.</b>
Fixing MSVC builds.
<li>
<b>Maintenance and testing of lesser-used drivers.</b>
Drivers such as i810, mach64, mga, r128, savage, sis, tdfx, unichrome, etc that aren't being maintained are being
deprecated starting in Mesa 8.0.<br>
They have to be ported to DRI2 to be accepted in mesa master again.
<li>
<b>Contribute more tests to
<a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~nh/piglit/" target="_parent">Piglit</a>.</b>
<li>
<b>Automatic testing.
</b>
It would be great if someone would set up an automated system for grabbing
the latest Mesa code and run tests (such as piglit) then report issues to
the mailing list.
</ol>


<p>
If you want to do something new in Mesa, first join the Mesa developer's
mailing list.
Then post a message to propose what you want to do, just to make sure
there's no issues.
</p>

<p>
Anyone is welcome to contribute code to the Mesa project.
By doing so, it's assumed that you agree to the code's licensing terms.
</p>

<p>
Finally:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to write high-quality code that follows the existing style.
<li>Use uniform indentation, write comments, use meaningful identifiers, etc.
<li>Test your code thoroughly.  Include test programs if appropriate.
</ol>
