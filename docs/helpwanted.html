We can always use more help with the Mesa project.  Here are some
specific areas.  If you think you can help out, post to the mesa3d-dev
mailing list.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 98/NT build/driver maintenance and testing (Karl Schultz has been
    doing a great job of this lately)
<li>DOS/DJGPP build/driver maintenance and testing
<li>GGI driver/build maintenance and testing
<li>GNU autoconfig/libtool maintenance (esp. on non-Linux systems)
<li>x86, SSE, 3DNow! and SPARC assembly language programming
<li>Implement WGL font functions in the WGL interface code
<li>Implement off-screen bitmap rendering support in the WGL interface code

<li>Implement the ARB_vertex/fragment extensions
<li>Download/compile/test Mesa and report any bugs found
</ul>


<p>
If you want to help with Mesa, first join the Mesa developer's
mailing list.  Then post a message explaining what you might like
to help with.  The Mesa web page has a list of a few work items
which you may consider.
</p>

</p>
Anyone is welcome to contribute code to the Mesa project, provided you
agree to the copyright terms of the relevant code.  See the COPYRIGHT
file.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, all the easy work in Mesa was done years ago.  Nowadays, the
work is rather complicated and not suited to beginners.
</p>

<p>
If you're contribution code to the Mesa library itself:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Try to write clean code (uniform indentation, comments, meaningful
      identifiers, etc).  It must be readable and maintainable!

<li>Test your code.  On several occations I've incorporated code from
      users which later turned out to have bugs.  Now, I'm pretty hesitant
      to use code which doesn't look good.
</ol>
