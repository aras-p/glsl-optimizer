<H1>Mesa 7.12 Release Notes / (release date TBD)</H1>

<p>
Mesa 7.12 is a new development release.
People who are concerned with stability and reliability should stick
with a previous release or wait for Mesa 7.12.1.
</p>
<p>
Mesa 7.12 implements the OpenGL 2.1 API, but the version reported by
glGetString(GL_VERSION) depends on the particular driver being used.
Some drivers don't support all the features required in OpenGL 2.1.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="install.html">Compiling/Installing page</a> for prerequisites
for DRI hardware acceleration.

<li>GL_ARB_depth_buffer_float (r600g)
<li>GL_ARB_vertex_type_2_10_10_10_rev (r600g)
<li>GL_EXT_packed_float (i965)
<li>GL_EXT_texture_array (r600g)
<li>GL_EXT_texture_shared_exponent (i965)

</ul>


<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
</ul>


<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removed all DRI drivers that did not support DRI2.  Specifically,
  i810, mach64, mga, r128, savage, sis, tdfx, and unichrome were
  removed.</li>
<li>Removed support for BeOS.</li>
<li>Removed the obsolete (and unmaintained) Windows "gldirect" and
  "ICD" drivers.</li>
<li>Removed the linux-fbdev software driver.</li>
<li>Removed all remnants of paletted texture support.  As required by
  desktop OpenGL, <tt>GL_COLOR_INDEX</tt> data can still be uploaded
  to a color (e.g., RGBA) texture.  However, the data cannot be stored
  internally as color-index.</li>
<li>Removed support for GL_APPLE_client_storage extension.
<li>Removed the classic Mesa r300 and r600 drivers, which are superseded
  by the gallium drivers for this hardware.
</ul>
